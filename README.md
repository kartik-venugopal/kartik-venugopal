### Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kartik Venugopal, a passionate software developer with a strong background in back-end Java programming (web services), and recent experience in Swift programming for native iOS / macOS apps.

I love object-oriented programming in general, and have recently come to love Swift's multi-paradigm power, syntactic sugar, and expressiveness.

I am keenly interested in microservices, cloud native computing, Ruby on Rails, and React / Node.js. I love to learn new languages / stacks in general.

I'm currently looking for software development work based in either Germany or Canada (open to other regions), so if you have a lead or are interested in hiring me, please reach out ! My LinkedIn page is: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kven/.

My main project on GitHub is [Aural Player](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player). I will aim to keep making this awesome app more awesome over time.

If you are able to and interested in providing localization help, I could definitely use collaborators for languages such as German, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.
