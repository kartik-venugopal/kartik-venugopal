### Hello ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kartik Venugopal, a passionate software developer with a strong background in back-end Java programming (web services) and the Spring framework, with recent experience in Swift programming for native iOS / macOS apps.

### My interests ###

I love object-oriented / functional programming and I love to learn new languages / stacks in general. I have recently come to love Swift's multi-paradigm power, extensibility, syntactic sugar, and concise expressiveness.

Some of my other interests include:
- Microservices
- Cloud-native computing
- Mobile computing (especially with Swift for iOS)
- Ruby on Rails
- React / Node.js, and other JavaScript-related technologies. 

### Learning ###

Though I am already familiar with Spring, I have not used Spring Boot so I am currently learning about it by developing a Java web app that implements a microservices architecture using the following technology stack:

- JDK 17
- Spring Boot 2.6.x
- PostgreSQL 14.x
- Hibernate (ORM) + Spring Data for data access
- Spring Web for ReSTful APIs
- React.js / Thymeleaf (front end)

### Aural Player ###

My main project on GitHub is [Aural Player](https://github.com/kartik-venugopal/aural-player). It has come a long way since its inception in 2016 and is reportedly liked and enjoyed by many :) I will aim to keep making this awesome app more awesome over time.

If you are able to and interested in providing localization help, I could definitely use collaborators for languages such as German, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.
